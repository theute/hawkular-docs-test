BZ# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1383414[1383414]

After creating a new datasource, it is not listed for the server.
This is caused by performing an AddDatasourceRequest action without specifying the datasourceProperties property.  Without this property the agent fails with an NullPointerException when it tries to add the datasource and the datasource is not created.

The root cause of this issue is https://issues.jboss.org/browse/HWKAGENT-146[HWKAGENT-1127], which has been resolved.  The fix is due in the next release of the middleware management agent.

The "Add Datasource" wizard currently only supports the addition of non-XA datasources.
The ability to create an XA datasource will be added in a future release.
