The middleware provider extends CloudForms management capabilities to JBoss Middleware application containers running in managed virtual machines, hosts, and Linux containers. The provider delivers inventory, events, metrics, and power operations. Middleware management in CloudForms is a provider based on the Hawkular open source project.  When feature complete, the middleware provider will replace the current Red Hat middleware management offering, JBoss Operations Network.
